My one and only netflix themed potfolio
# Netflix-Themed Portfolio | PLP Hackathon Edition

Welcome to my personal **Netflix-themed developer portfolio**, proudly built during the **Presidential Digital Talent Program (PLP)** hackathon challenge. It’s more than just a website — it’s an experience designed to let my skills, creativity, and personality shine through a UI inspired by the world’s most addictive streaming platform.

>  Made with  by **Simon Wanyoike Gatungo** aka **SK / Daktari**

## Project Purpose

This project was my unique submission during the PLP Hackathon under the theme:  
> _“Innovative Self-Presentation for the Digital Workforce.”_

I didn’t want a basic resume site. I wanted to **wow**, to stand out, and to give anyone who visits my portfolio — be it a recruiter, investor, partner, or tech buddy — a reason to remember **me**.

## 💡 Why Netflix Theme?

- Keep users hooked like they're binge-watching a dev series
- Create a *memorable impression*
