    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div class="about-box">
      
      <p>As a third-year B.Tech CSE (IoT) student at Shiv Nadar University,Chennai, I’m deeply passionate about applying technology to solve real-world problems. My work bridges the domains of Artificial Intelligence, embedded systems, and full-stack development—whether it's building intelligent IoT solutions, optimizing embedded architectures, or developing scalable web applications. I thrive on hands-on implementation, and I’m driven by a commitment to create impactful, innovative systems through thoughtful design and problem-solving.

    <div class="project">
      <h3>Alert Image Identification System</h3>
      <p>Developed a real-time computer vision system that detects and logs multiple classes of safety alerts directly from webcam feeds. The system uses a fine-tuned MobileNetV2 model trained with heavily augmented image data to ensure high accuracy and generalization.

Built a custom alert detection pipeline with confidence scoring, buffered predictions, and crash-resistant logging.

Integrated browser-based webcam access using JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas for real-time frame capture.

Designed a safety-focused logger that records timestamps, alert types, durations, and confidence levels with built-in recovery and backup mechanisms.

Optimized for responsive, real-time performance with clean UI overlays showing live alerts and system status.

Includes features like retry handling, duration tracking, and automatic alert filtering to reduce false positives.

This project demonstrates practical skills in transfer learning, model deployment, real-time processing, and building robust systems from the ground up. Built during internship.</p>

      <h3>Human Emotion Detection</h3>
      <p>Tech Stack: Python, TensorFlow, OpenCV
Status: In Progress (Hackathon Project)

Developing a real-time facial emotion recognition system that classifies expressions like Happy, Sad, and Angry using a CNN trained on facial expression datasets.

Achieved ~85% accuracy on validation data using a custom convolutional model.

Integrated OpenCV to capture webcam feed and display detected emotions dynamically on screen.

Designed for real-time inference with smooth updates and minimal latency.

Focused on building a lightweight, intuitive user interface for live emotion feedback.

Currently optimizing for performance and adding support for a broader range of emotions.

This project applies deep learning to a real-world interactive use case and strengthens understanding of emotion modeling through visual cues.</p>

      <h3>Instagram-style Backend</h3>
      <p>Tech Stack: Flask, SQL, HTML/CSS/JavaScript
Type: Full-Stack Personal Project

Built the backend for a simplified social media platform inspired by Instagram, supporting user posts, comments, and interaction logic.

Developed RESTful APIs using Flask for user authentication, post uploads, and content retrieval.

Designed a relational database schema using SQL to manage users, posts, and likes efficiently.

Connected the backend to a responsive frontend built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

Ensured secure communication and proper routing between frontend and backend for seamless interaction.

Focused on code modularity and scalability for future expansion (e.g., stories, messaging).

This project demonstrates full-stack development ability and the design of production-style backend systems..</p>
