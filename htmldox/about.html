      Hey! I'm <strong>Simon Wanyoike Gatungo</strong>, but everyone calls me <strong>SK</strong>  or even <strong>Daktari</strong> if you know me well. I’m a proud Kenyan, born with curiosity in my veins and technology in my soul.
    </p>
    <br>
    
    <p class="info-desc">
      I’m currently finalizing my Bachelor’s degree in Information Technology at the University of Embu, graduating in September 2025. But truthfully, I didn’t wait for graduation to start building. I’ve been coding, designing systems, supporting users, and dreaming big from the jump.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="info-desc">
      Whether it's an <strong>e-health app</strong> that helps patients access care easier, a <strong>mental wellness platform</strong> to support students, or a <strong>secure online voting system</strong> that was used to elect real leaders  I build what matters.
    </p>
    <br>
    
    <p class="info-desc">
      I’ve also worked with <strong>Kenya Rural Roads Authority Murang'a Region</strong>, where I got my hands dirty with real IT support work, database setups, user systems, and network administration. That experience? It grounded me in real-world tech.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="info-desc">
      But tech isn’t just code to me. It’s about people. I love solving problems that matter, uplifting communities, and building things that serve, protect, and inspire. My dream? To use software, data, and machine learning to transform how Africa lives, learns, and leads.
    </p>
<br>
<br>
    <p class="info-desc">
      I’m not done yet. I’m just getting started. I’m here to learn, grow, and make a difference. If you share my passion for tech that matters, let’s connect! I’m always up for a chat about ideas, projects, or just the latest in tech.
